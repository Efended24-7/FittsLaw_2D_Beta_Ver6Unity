Fitts Law:
- 2D Environment 
- Create a square to click on to summon another square
- Have multiple stages where each stage can have a different scenario like a squares width increases or a squares position changes
- Measure the time and distance it takes to get from one square to another

- Fitts Law Equation
- From Figma Website:
While you won’t need math to understand Fitts’ law, it was originally expressed as a mathematical formula: MT = A + B * log₂ (2D/W). Let’s break down each of these components:

MT, or movement time, is the time it takes to move to a target.
A and B are constants that change based on the input device (like a mouse cursor or a finger) and reaction time.
D is the distance to the target.
W is the width of the target.
Log₂ is a logarithmic function.

Let’s say you have a button that’s 60 pixels wide at a distance of 100 pixels from a cursor. 
You’ve determined your constants as 0.4 and 0.2. 
Your example formula will look like MT= 0.4 + 0.2 * log₂ (2*100/60). 
Solving for MT, you get 0.75, approximately how many seconds it will take to reach the button with a cursor.
